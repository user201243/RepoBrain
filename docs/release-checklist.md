# Release Checklist

RepoBrain releases should be boring, reproducible, and explicit. Do not publish because code changed; publish because a user-facing capability is meaningfully more complete or more trustworthy.

## Before A Release

- Confirm `CHANGELOG.md` describes the release in user-facing language.
- Confirm `pyproject.toml` has the intended version and final repository URLs.
- Run `python -m compileall src tests`.
- Run `python -m pytest -q`.
- Run `repobrain quickstart`.
- Run `repobrain doctor --format text`.
- Run `repobrain index --format text` on a clean sample repo.
- Run one `query`, one `trace`, one `impact`, and one `targets` command with `--format text`.
- Run `repobrain report --format text` and confirm `.repobrain/report.html` is generated.
- If remote providers are part of the release notes, run a live-key smoke test for each configured provider outside CI.

## Manual GitHub Release Workflow

The workflow at `.github/workflows/release.yml` is intentionally manual.

Default mode:

- `publish = false`
- builds wheel and sdist
- runs compile and tests
- uploads `dist/*` as a GitHub Actions artifact

Publish mode:

- `publish = true`
- performs the same build and test gates
- publishes to PyPI through trusted publishing

## Tagging

Recommended tag format:

```text
v0.1.0
v0.2.0
v0.3.0
```

Tag only after the release artifact build succeeds. If the first public release includes parser hardening and provider adapters, prefer `v0.2.0`; otherwise use `v0.1.0`.

## Rollback

- Do not delete source history to hide a bad release.
- Mark the GitHub release as pre-release or withdrawn if needed.
- Publish a patch version with a clear changelog entry.
- Keep local-first defaults unchanged unless there is an explicit security reason.
