### Release

- Added a manual GitHub Actions release workflow for wheel/sdist builds
- Kept PyPI publishing behind an explicit `publish = true` workflow input

### Engine

- Added SDK-backed optional OpenAI and Voyage embedding providers
- Added SDK-backed optional Cohere reranker provider
- Added SDK-backed optional Gemini embedding and Gemini Flash reranker providers
- Added repo-root `.env` loading without overriding existing shell environment variables
- Added `.env.example` with cheap Gemini setup using `gemini-embedding-001` and `gemini-3-flash-preview`
- Added provider model option wiring for `repobrain.toml` and environment overrides
- Added test-surface ranking penalties so runtime queries prefer route/service/source files unless the query asks for tests
- Added confidence downgrade and warnings when non-test queries only find test-file evidence
- Added confidence calibration band tests for grounded vs weak evidence
- Fixed local hash embeddings to use stable `blake2b` slots instead of Python process-randomized `hash()`
- Improved Python and TS/JS named import extraction so `imports_call` edges capture imported bindings and aliases
- Made index reset more Windows-friendly by rebuilding SQLite schema instead of unlinking the database file
- Hardened `indexed()` so empty or partially-created metadata databases are not treated as usable indexes
- Improved lexical score normalization for FTS retrieval
- Expanded default indexing excludes for local virtualenv and pytest temp folders
- Reworked retrieval fusion to combine query variants and source diversity more cleanly
- Made `build_change_context` more compact and planning-oriented
- Added stronger warnings for narrow or single-source evidence
- Added contradiction-aware warnings for mismatched provider or surface evidence
- Added an optional parser adapter layer that prefers tree-sitter when available and falls back to heuristics
- Added parser usage counts to `repobrain index`

### CLI

- Added active repo memory so `repobrain init --repo <path>` lets later commands omit `--repo`
- Added `repobrain serve-web` for a local browser import and query flow
- Added `--format text` for human-readable terminal output while keeping JSON as default
- Added `repobrain report` to generate a local static HTML dashboard
- Added `repobrain report --open` for opening the generated dashboard in the default browser
- Added `repobrain quickstart` for new-user onboarding
- Updated chat mode to use readable text by default with `/json` and `/text` toggles
- Added `report.cmd` as a Windows-friendly one-click local dashboard launcher
- Added `python -m repobrain.cli` entrypoint support for source-tree launchers
- Updated `chat.cmd` to prefer `venv\Scripts\python.exe` or `.venv\Scripts\python.exe` before falling back to global Python
- Added `repobrain chat` for a local interactive question loop
- Added `chat.cmd` as a Windows-friendly one-click local chat launcher

### Security

- Added provider readiness and security posture details to `repobrain doctor`
- Hardened MCP tool validation for unknown tools, invalid arguments, and oversized queries
- Expanded security and run docs with local-transport and remote-provider guidance

## 0.1.0

- Initial RepoBrain MVP
- Local CLI for init, index, query, trace, impact, targets, benchmark, doctor, and serve-mcp
- SQLite metadata store plus persisted vector index
- Python + TS/JS scanning with heuristic symbol extraction
- Hybrid retrieval and evidence-driven edit target ranking
- OSS launch documentation and fixture-backed tests
